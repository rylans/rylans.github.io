RWD emphasises readability, navigation and support for many kinds of devices.</p><p>When designing a web site this way, people suggest to use percents instead of pixels in the CSS. These relative units are supposed to increase flexibility. Doing user-agent detection and browser detection seem to be an unreliable way of doing responsive design and they should not be relied upon.</p><h3><a name="media" class="anchor" href="#media"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Media Queries</h3><p>When I first learned about responsive design, I thought that it was all about <code>@media</code> queries. So I when I wanted to make my site look decent on my Android mobile device, I thought that I just had to put some lines in my css like this:</p><pre><code>@media only screen and (max-width: 479px) { ... }
</code></pre><p>After doing so, reloading the page and then manually resizing the window, it looked like the content got adjusted based on the media query. But when I took my phone and went to the website, it showed the version of the site that I intended for large screen width users.</p><p>I later learned that what I was missing is the meta viewport tag.</p><h3><a name="viewport" class="anchor" href="#viewport"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Meta Viewport</h3><p>My Android's resolution in portrait mode is 320x640 but what was happening is that unless the viewport is explicitly set, the Android Chrome browser was acting like it had a 980px width.</p><p>So I put the following meta viewport statement into my <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> and then it seemed to work fine on my mobile device.</p><pre><code>&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width"&gt;
