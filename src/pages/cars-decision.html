<p>
I'd like to explore the implications of autonomous vehicles and decision theory.
Consider this dilemma posed by Lin:</p>

<blockquote>
 Imagine in some distant future, your autonomous car encounters this terrible choice:
 it must either swerve left and strike an eight-year old girl, or swerve right and strike an
 80-year old grandmother [33]. Given the carâ€™s velocity, either victim would surely be killed
 on impact. If you do not swerve, both victims will be struck and killed; so there is good
 reason to think that you ought to swerve one way or another.
</blockquote>

<p>
In this case, the decision making agent (the autonomous car) must make a killing decision. It must
choose to kill the girl or the old lady. There is no viable third option. Failure to make a decision
is deciding to do nothing. Deciding to do nothing involves the death of two people instead of
the death of one.
</p>

<p>
You can't even get out of this dilemma by saying that the car should cede control the person sitting
in the driver seat because humans have slower reaction times and may need several seconds to get
reoriented (Lin). It would be extremely negligent to hand over control to a human every time
a difficult problem occurs. This would ensure the worst possible outcome in this case.
</p>

<p>
I suppose the naive way of answering the question is to say that children are less massive than
adults and colliding with less massive objects cause less injury to the passengers of the car. By
this line of reasoning, the decision would be to swerve and kill the girl.
</p>

<p>
This answer is naive because it misses the crux of the problem. The problem is that a decision making
agent must make a decision based on superficial features of an object in real time. Suppose that instead of
an old lady and a young girl, we have a 35kg boy and a 35kg girl standing on the road. 
</p>

<p>
What would you choose? Would you kill the little boy or the little girl? 'Neither' is not an answer. 'Neither' means
'both.' You must make a decision. Failure to make a decision is deciding to do nothing. Deciding to do nothing
is letting both die. What should an autonomous vehicle choose?
</p>

<p>
This problem seems strikingly similar to Buridan's paradox.
